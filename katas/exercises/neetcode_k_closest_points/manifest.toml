description = """K Closest Points to Origin (LeetCode 973)

Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane
and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).

The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance
(i.e., sqrt((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2)).

You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique
(except for the order that it is in).

Example 1:
Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1
Output: [[-2,2]]
Explanation:
Distance between (1, 3) and origin is sqrt(10).
Distance between (-2, 2) and origin is sqrt(8).
Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to origin.

Example 2:
Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2
Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]

Constraints:
- 1 <= k <= points.length <= 10^4
- -10^4 <= xi, yi <= 10^4
