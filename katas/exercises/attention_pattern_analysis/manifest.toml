[DEPRECATED - Use micro-katas instead]

This kata has been split into focused micro-exercises:
1. extract_attention_patterns - Extract patterns from cache
2. compute_attention_entropy - Calculate entropy of attention
3. find_previous_token_heads - Identify previous-token heads
4. ablate_attention_head - Ablate heads with uniform pattern
5. compare_attention_patterns - Compare patterns across prompts
6. get_max_attention_positions - Find top-k attended positions

This composite kata combines all techniques for advanced practice.

Key concepts: attention extraction, pattern interpretation, entropy, head ablation, induction heads
