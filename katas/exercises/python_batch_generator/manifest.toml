Learn the basics of Python generators and the yield keyword. Implement a simple
generator that yields batches from a sequence. This is the foundation for understanding
how generators work: they produce values on demand without materializing the entire
sequence in memory.

Key concepts:
- yield keyword for producing values
- Generator state preservation between yields
- Lazy evaluation and memory efficiency
- StopIteration protocol
