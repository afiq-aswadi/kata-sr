description = """Time Based Key-Value Store (LeetCode 981)

Design a time-based key-value data structure that can store multiple values for the same key
at different time stamps and retrieve the key's value at a certain timestamp.

Implement the TimeMap class:
- TimeMap() Initializes the object
- set(key, value, timestamp): Stores the key with the value at the given timestamp
- get(key, timestamp): Returns a value such that set was called previously, with
  timestamp_prev <= timestamp. If there are multiple such values, returns the value
  with the largest timestamp_prev. If there are no values, returns "".

Example 1:
Input:
["TimeMap", "set", "get", "get", "set", "get", "get"]
[[], ["foo", "bar", 1], ["foo", 1], ["foo", 3], ["foo", "bar2", 4], ["foo", 4], ["foo", 5]]
Output:
[null, null, "bar", "bar", null, "bar2", "bar2"]

Constraints:
- 1 <= key.length, value.length <= 100
- key and value consist of lowercase English letters and digits
- 1 <= timestamp <= 10^7
- All timestamps in set are strictly increasing
