[DEPRECATED - Use micro-katas instead]

This kata has been split into focused micro-exercises:
1. hook_capture_activation - basic activation capture
2. hook_ablate_activation - ablate/zero out activations
3. hook_patch_activation - patch activations from source
4. hook_attribution_patching - attribution patching

This composite kata combines all techniques for advanced practice.

Key concepts: hook points, activation extraction, model inspection, caching
