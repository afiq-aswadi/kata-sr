description = """Car Fleet (LeetCode 853)

There are n cars at given miles from the starting mile 0, traveling to reach the mile target.

You are given two integer arrays position and speed. The i-th car starts at position[i] miles
and travels at speed[i] miles per hour. A car can never pass another car, but it can catch up to it.

Return the number of car fleets that will arrive at the destination.

Example 1:
Input: target = 12, position = [10,8,0,5,3], speed = [2,4,1,1,3]
Output: 3

Constraints:
- n == position.length == speed.length
- 1 <= n <= 10^5
