Implement a metaclass that validates required class attributes.

Create a metaclass that enforces constraints at class definition time. Classes
must define a 'required_attributes' list, and the metaclass checks that all
required attributes are present, raising TypeError if any are missing.

Key concepts: metaclass __new__, class validation, raising errors at class creation
