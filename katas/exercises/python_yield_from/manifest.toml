Learn the yield from syntax for delegating to sub-generators. This powerful feature
allows you to delegate iteration to another generator completely, which is especially
useful for recursive generators and composing generator functions.

Key concepts:
- yield from delegates to sub-generators
- Passes all values from sub-generator to caller
- More efficient than manual iteration
- Essential for recursive generators
- Transparent delegation of send() and throw()
