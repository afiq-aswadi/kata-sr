Implement the Singleton pattern using Python metaclasses.

Create a metaclass that ensures only one instance of a class exists, no matter
how many times the class is instantiated. This is a classic design pattern
used for database connections, loggers, and configuration managers.

Key concepts: metaclass __call__, instance caching, singleton pattern
