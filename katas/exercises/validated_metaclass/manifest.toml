Implement a metaclass that validates required class attributes.

Create a metaclass that enforces constraints at class definition time. The class
must check that all required attributes are present, raising TypeError if any
are missing. This pattern is used in frameworks for schema validation and ORM models.

Key concepts: metaclass __new__, class validation, enforcing constraints
