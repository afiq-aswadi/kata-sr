[DEPRECATED - Use micro-katas instead]

This kata has been split into focused micro-exercises:
1. dp_fibonacci - basic memoization
2. dp_longest_subsequence - LCS with 2D table
3. dp_knapsack - 0/1 knapsack optimization
4. dp_edit_distance - Levenshtein distance

This composite kata combines multiple DP problems for advanced practice.

Key concepts: memoization, tabulation, optimal substructure, overlapping subproblems
