description = """Merge Triplets to Form Target Triplet (LeetCode 1899)

A triplet is an array of three integers. You are given a 2D integer array triplets, where
triplets[i] = [ai, bi, ci] describes the ith triplet. You are also given an integer array
target = [x, y, z] that describes the triplet you want to obtain.

To obtain target, you may apply the following operation on triplets any number of times:
- Choose two indices i and j and update triplets[j] to become [max(ai, aj), max(bi, bj), max(ci, cj)].

Return true if it is possible to obtain the target triplet as an element of triplets, or false otherwise.

Example 1:
Input: triplets = [[2,5,3],[1,8,4],[1,7,5]], target = [2,7,5]
Output: true
Explanation: Perform the operation on index 0 and 1: [max(2,1), max(5,8), max(3,4)] = [2,8,4]
Then, operation on index 0 and 2: [max(2,1), max(8,7), max(4,5)] = [2,8,5]
Finally, operation on index 0 again: [max(2,2), max(8,7), max(5,5)] = [2,8,5] (simplified).

Example 2:
Input: triplets = [[3,4,5],[4,5,6]], target = [3,2,5]
Output: false

Constraints:
- 1 <= triplets.length <= 10^5
- triplets[i].length == target.length == 3
- 1 <= ai, bi, ci, x, y, z <= 1000
