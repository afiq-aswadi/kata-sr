description = """Number of Connected Components in Undirected Graph (LeetCode 323)

You have a graph of n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1. You are given an integer n and a list
of edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an undirected edge between nodes
ai and bi in the graph.

Return the number of connected components in the graph.

Example 1:
Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[3,4]]
Output: 2

Example 2:
Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
Output: 1

Constraints:
- 1 <= n <= 2000
- 0 <= edges.length <= 5000
- edges[i].length == 2
- 0 <= ai <= bi < n
- ai != bi
- There are no repeated edges.
