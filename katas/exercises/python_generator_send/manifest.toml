Learn bidirectional communication with generators using the send() method. This advanced
generator feature allows you to pass values INTO a running generator, enabling stateful
processing and coroutine-like behavior.

Key concepts:
- send() method for passing values to generators
- Bidirectional communication (yield both sends and receives)
- Stateful generators that maintain local variables
- Priming generators with next() before sending
- Using generators for stream processing
