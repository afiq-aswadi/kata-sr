Systematically compute attribution scores across all layers and positions.

Complete attribution patching workflow: patch every position in every layer,
measuring how much each contributes to a target metric. Core technique for
circuit discovery and understanding model computation.

Key concepts: systematic attribution, layer-wise analysis, metric functions, circuit discovery
