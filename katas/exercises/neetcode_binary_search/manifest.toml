description = """Binary Search (LeetCode 704)

Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target,
write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4

Example 2:
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
Output: -1

Constraints:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^4
- -10^4 < nums[i], target < 10^4
- All integers in nums are unique
- nums is sorted in ascending order
