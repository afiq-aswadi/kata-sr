Deep dive into Python generators and the iteration protocol. Implement generators
using yield, generator expressions, and the full send/throw protocol for bidirectional
communication. Understanding generators is crucial for memory-efficient iteration and
coroutine patterns.

Key concepts:
- yield vs return
- Generator state suspension/resumption
- send() for bidirectional communication
- throw() for exception injection
- yield from for delegation
- Generator expressions vs list comprehensions
