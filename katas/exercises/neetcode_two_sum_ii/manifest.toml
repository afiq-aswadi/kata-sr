description = """Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted (LeetCode 167)

Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order,
find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

Return the indices of the two numbers (1-indexed) as an integer array [index1, index2].

Example 1:
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]

Example 2:
Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
Output: [1,3]

Example 3:
Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
Output: [1,2]

Constraints:
- 2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 10^4
- -1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000
- numbers is sorted in non-decreasing order
- -1000 <= target <= 1000
- Only one valid answer exists
