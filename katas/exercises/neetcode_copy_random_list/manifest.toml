description = """Copy List with Random Pointer (LeetCode 138)

A linked list of length n is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer,
which could point to any node in the list, or null.

Construct a deep copy of the list. The deep copy should consist of exactly n brand new nodes,
where each new node has its value set to the value of its corresponding original node. Both
the next and random pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list such
that the pointers in the original list and copied list represent the same list state.

Return the head of the copied linked list.

Example 1:
Input: head = [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
Output: [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]

Example 2:
Input: head = [[1,1],[2,1]]
Output: [[1,1],[2,1]]

Example 3:
Input: head = [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]
Output: [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]

Constraints:
- 0 <= n <= 1000
- -10^4 <= Node.val <= 10^4
- Node.random is null or is pointing to some node in the linked list
