Implement depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS) for graph traversal.

Given an adjacency list representation of a graph, traverse all reachable nodes.
Handle cycles properly with a visited set.

Key concepts: graph traversal, recursion vs iteration, stack vs queue, cycle detection
