description = """Count Good Nodes in Binary Tree (LeetCode 1448)

Given a binary tree root, a node X in the tree is named good if in the path from root to X there are no nodes with a value greater than X.

Return the number of good nodes in the binary tree.

Example 1:
Input: root = [3,1,4,3,null,1,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Root Node (3) is always good.
Node 4 -> (3,4) is the max value in the path.
Node 5 -> (3,4,5) is the max value in the path.
Node 3 -> (3,1,3) is the max value in the path.

Example 2:
Input: root = [3,3,null,4,2]
Output: 3

Example 3:
Input: root = [1]
Output: 1

Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the binary tree is in the range [1, 10^5]
- Each node's value is between [-10^4, 10^4]
