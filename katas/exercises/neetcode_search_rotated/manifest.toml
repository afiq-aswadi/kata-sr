description = """Search in Rotated Sorted Array (LeetCode 33)

There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).
The array is rotated at an unknown pivot. Given the array after rotation and an integer target,
return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4

Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1

Constraints:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 5000
- -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
- All values of nums are unique
