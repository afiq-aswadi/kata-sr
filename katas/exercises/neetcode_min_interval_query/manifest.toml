description = """Minimum Interval to Include Each Query (LeetCode 1851)

You are given a 2D integer array intervals, where intervals[i] = [lefti, righti] describes the
ith interval starting at lefti and ending at righti (inclusive). The size of an interval is
defined as the number of integers it contains, or more formally righti - lefti + 1.

You are also given an integer array queries. The answer to the jth query is the size of the
smallest interval i such that lefti <= queries[j] <= righti. If no such interval exists, the answer is -1.

Return an array containing the answers to the queries.

Example 1:
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[2,4],[3,6],[4,4]], queries = [2,3,4,5]
Output: [3,3,1,4]

Example 2:
Input: intervals = [[2,3],[2,5],[1,8],[20,25]], queries = [2,19,5,22]
Output: [2,-1,4,6]

Constraints:
- 1 <= intervals.length <= 10^5
- 1 <= queries.length <= 10^5
- intervals[i].length == 2
- 1 <= lefti <= righti <= 10^7
- 1 <= queries[j] <= 10^7
