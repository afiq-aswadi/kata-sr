description = """Detect Squares (LeetCode 2013)

You are given a stream of points on the X-Y plane. Design an algorithm that:
- Adds new points from the stream into a data structure. Duplicate points are allowed and should be treated as different points.
- Given a query point, counts the number of ways to choose three points from the data structure such that the three points and the query point form an axis-aligned square with positive area.

An axis-aligned square is a square whose edges are all the same length and are either parallel or perpendicular to the x-axis and y-axis.

Implement the DetectSquares class:
- DetectSquares() Initializes the object with an empty data structure.
- void add(int[] point) Adds a new point point = [x, y] to the data structure.
- int count(int[] point) Counts the number of ways to form axis-aligned squares with point point = [x, y] as described above.

Example 1:
Input:
["DetectSquares", "add", "add", "add", "count", "count", "add", "count"]
[[], [[3, 10]], [[11, 2]], [[3, 2]], [[11, 10]], [[14, 8]], [[11, 2]], [[11, 10]]]
Output:
[null, null, null, null, 1, 0, null, 2]

Constraints:
- point.length == 2
- 0 <= x, y <= 1000
- At most 3000 calls in total will be made to add and count
