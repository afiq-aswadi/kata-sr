description = """Find Median from Data Stream (LeetCode 295)

The median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even,
there is no middle value, and the median is the mean of the two middle values.

Implement the MedianFinder class:
- MedianFinder() initializes the MedianFinder object.
- void addNum(int num) adds the integer num from the data stream to the data structure.
- double findMedian() returns the median of all elements so far.

Example:
medianFinder = MedianFinder()
medianFinder.addNum(1)
medianFinder.addNum(2)
medianFinder.findMedian()  # return 1.5
medianFinder.addNum(3)
medianFinder.findMedian()  # return 2.0

Constraints:
- -10^5 <= num <= 10^5
- There will be at least one element in the data structure before calling findMedian
- At most 5 * 10^4 calls will be made to addNum and findMedian

Follow up:
- If all integer numbers from the stream are in the range [0, 100], how would you optimize?
- If 99% of all integer numbers are in the range [0, 100], how would you optimize?
