[DEPRECATED - Use micro-katas instead]

This kata has been split into focused micro-exercises:
1. patch_single_position - patch one token position
2. patch_residual_stream - measure direct effects
3. compute_attribution_scores - systematic attribution across layers

This composite kata combines all patching techniques for advanced practice.

Key concepts: causal intervention, activation patching, circuit analysis, counterfactuals
