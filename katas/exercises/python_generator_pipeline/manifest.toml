description = """
Learn how to chain generators together to create processing pipelines. This demonstrates
the power of generators for memory-efficient data transformation: each stage processes
one item at a time without materializing intermediate results.

Key concepts:
- Composing generators by passing one to another
- Pipeline architecture for data processing
- Lazy evaluation through the entire chain
- Memory efficiency of chained generators
