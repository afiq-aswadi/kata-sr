[DEPRECATED - Use micro-katas instead]

This kata has been split into focused micro-exercises:
1. extract_attention_pattern - extract patterns from cache
2. compute_attention_entropy - measure attention focus/diffusion
3. find_previous_token_heads - identify previous-token heads
4. ablate_attention_head - ablate heads to measure impact
5. get_max_attention_position - find max attention targets
6. compare_attention_patterns - compare patterns across prompts
7. analyze_induction_head - detect induction behavior

This composite kata combines all attention analysis techniques for advanced practice.

Key concepts: attention pattern extraction, visualization, entropy, head ablation, induction heads
