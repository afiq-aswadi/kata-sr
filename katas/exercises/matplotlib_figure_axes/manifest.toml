description = """
Master matplotlib's object-oriented interface with the fundamental fig, ax pattern.

Learn to create plots using fig, ax = plt.subplots() instead of the pyplot
state machine. This is the foundation for all professional matplotlib usage.

Key Skills:
- Creating figures and axes explicitly
- Using the OO interface (ax.plot, ax.set_xlabel, etc.)
- Styling plots with colors, line styles, labels
- Adding legends and grids
- Proper layout management

This single-function kata focuses on the core pattern you'll use in every
matplotlib visualization. Master this before moving to subplots and advanced plots.
