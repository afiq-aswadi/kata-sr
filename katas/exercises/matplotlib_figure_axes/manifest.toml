Master the fundamental matplotlib figure/axes pattern and create customized multi-panel plots.

Learn to properly structure plots using the object-oriented interface (fig, ax) rather than
pyplot state machine. This is essential for creating publication-quality figures.

Key Concepts:
- fig, ax = plt.subplots() pattern
- Axes vs Figure hierarchy
- Object-oriented vs state machine interface
- tight_layout() for spacing
- Color specifications (named, hex, RGB)
- Line styles and markers

Implementation Requirements:
- Create a figure with 2x2 subplots showing different plot types
- Customize each subplot with titles, axis labels, legends, and grid
- Implement custom colors, line styles, and markers
- Add a figure-level title (suptitle)
- Adjust subplot spacing using tight_layout
