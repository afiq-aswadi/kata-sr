description = """Meeting Rooms (LeetCode 252)

Given an array of meeting time intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], determine if a
person could attend all meetings.

Example 1:
Input: intervals = [[0,30],[5,10],[15,20]]
Output: false
Explanation: Meeting [0,30] overlaps with [5,10] and [15,20].

Example 2:
Input: intervals = [[7,10],[2,4]]
Output: true

Constraints:
- 0 <= intervals.length <= 10^4
- intervals[i].length == 2
- 0 <= starti < endi <= 10^6
